If your center is Principles...  
PLEASURE: Joy that comes from almost any activity in a focused life. True re-creation as an important part of a balanced integrated life-style.  
FRIENDS: Companions in interdependent living. Confidants -- those to share with, serve, and support.  
ENEMIES: No real perceived "enemies"; just people with different paradigms and agendas to be understood and cared about.  
CHURCH: Vehicle for true principles. Opportunity for service and contribution.  
SELF: One unique, talented, creative individual in the midst of many unique, talented, creative individuals who, working independently and interdependently, can accomplish great things.  
PRINCIPLES: Immutable natural laws which cannot be violated with impunity. When honored, preserve integrity and thus lead to true growth and happiness.  

Thomas Wolfe was wrong. You can go home again -- if your home is a treasured relationship, a precious companionship.
